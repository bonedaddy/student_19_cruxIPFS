# Data

All the data file required to run a simulation are stored in this folder.

- [gen/](gen) contains the information used to generate a topology on deterlab. This folder is generated by the script [detergen.sh](../scripts/detergen.sh) using [gen.go](../detergen/gen.go) code.
- [install/](install) contains the programs ipfs and ipfs-cluster that need to be installed on the remote hosts.
- [results/](results) contains the parsed data useful for the plots.
- [details.txt](details.txt) contains the details of the simulation. This file is generated by [run.sh](../scripts/run.sh), and is used to pass simulation parameters to [simulation.go](../simulation/simulation.go). It was necessary to create such a file, as Cothority does have a way to pass parameters to its simulation (or I was not able to find it).
- [nodes.txt](nodes.txt) contains each node of the network indiviual information: node name, X and Y coordinates, IP address and ARA level. This file is generated by the script [detergen.sh](../scripts/detergen.sh) using [gen.go](../detergen/gen.go) code.
