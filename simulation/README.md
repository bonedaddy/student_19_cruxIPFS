# simulation

This folder contains the main experimence conducted in this project.

## [const.go](const.go)

This file contains the constants used in the folder [simulation](.).

## [helpers.go](helpers.go)

This file contains the helpers methods used in the folder [simulation](.).

## [ipfs.toml](ipfs.toml)

This file contains the Onet simulation details. It is generally generated by the scripts [run.sh](../scripts/run.sh), but can also be edited manually.

## [service.go](service.go)

This file contains the main code of the experiment. First in `Setup()`, some files required for the simulation are copied on the remote hosts, then simulation parameters are loaded. Each peer runs the `Node()` method and generate all ARAs. Finally, in `Run()` run only on the root of the Onet tree, all IPFS and IPFS Cluster daemon start, and the performance test is run.

Note that the execution is most likely to take more than the 3 minutes Onet can handle, so just discard Onet error messages, when run on the remote host, the simulation will continue to output messages in the command line eventhough Onet says it stopped the program.

## [struct.go](struct.go)

This file contains the structures used in the folder [simulation](.).
